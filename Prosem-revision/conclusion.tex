\chapter{Conclusion}
We can conclude that remote working is as important as ever and Augmented reality has the potential to solve many problems that come with remote collaboration. A very important aspect is the design of the virtual avatar because the perceived social presence of virtual agents and avatars contributes significantly to the user having a pleasant experience.
Future work could improve on the studies and test the effect of different AR avatar appearances with varying groups of age or in different settings like in a hospital or school, not just work, because we found that different avatar appearances suit different needs, certain appearances are for example more professional while others are more friendly.

In general, this is definitely a topic to follow closely in the future because with the improvement of AR technology and additional investments from big tech companies the potential for solving these problems only grows.
